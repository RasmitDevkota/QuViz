Welcome to QuViz, the neutral atom quantum computer compilation visualization tool! This is an open-sourced and updated version of the (QRISE 2024 - QuEra Challenge)[https://github.com/RasmitDevkota/QRISE_2024] project created by Team Rydberg Rangers.

QuViz allows users to compose a quantum circuit or type up an OpenQASM3 program and see it played out in real time!

## Usage

QuViz can be started by running `python ./src/main.py`. A virtual environment is highly recommended.

## Program layout

Inputs:
- Circuit composer
- OpenQASM3

Functionality:
- Visualization of large neutral atom arrays

Outputs:
- Transpiled circuit
- Simulated statevector

## Contributing

We want QuViz to be a useful program that anyone can use, so we very much welcome contributions in the form of issues and pull requests!
